# head-pose-estimation
Welcome to the Real-time Head Movement Detection and Face Landmark Recognition project repository. This project is aimed at developing a computer vision model that can detect facial landmarks in real-time and perform head movement detection. Additionally, it incorporates an interactive game where the system prompts the user to perform specific actions accurately.

# Project Description
# Facial Landmark Detection
The core functionality of this project is the detection of facial landmarks in real-time. The system utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to identify key points on the face, such as eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. This provides valuable data for tracking facial movements and expressions.

# Head Movement Detection
The project extends beyond facial landmark detection to include head movement tracking. By analyzing the changes in the positions of facial landmarks over time, the system can detect various head movements, such as nods, shakes, tilts, and rotations. ![git6](https://github.com/nourhenehanana/head-pose-estimation/assets/93352403/e7bb9f7e-045d-400a-ab75-bd2187e942e7)

# Interactive Game
One of the unique features of this project is the interactive game component. The system prompts the user to perform specific head movements or facial expressions correctly based on randomly generated actions. Users can engage with the system by following these prompts, making it an enjoyable and interactive experience.


# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You need libraries MediaPipe, numpy, openCv.

Run the Application: Execute the main application script to start the real-time head movement detection and facial landmark recognition.

Play the Game: Engage with the interactive game by following the prompts provided by the system. Try to perform the actions accurately to achieve the best scores.
